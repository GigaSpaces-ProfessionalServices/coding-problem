Please provide a Java program to answer the following question:

 
<pre>
Given an arbitrary text document written in English, write a program that will generate a concordance. A Concordance is an alphabetical list of all word occurrences labeled with word frequencies. Bonus label each word with the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared.
</pre>
 
The input is available in the file **input.txt**.

Sample output is as follows:

a => 3 {1,1,2}<br/>
all => 1 {2}<br/>
alphabetical => 1 {2}<br/>
an => 2 {1,2}<br/>
appeared => 1 {3}<br/>
arbitrary => 1 {1}<br/>
bonus => 1 {3}<br/>
concordance => 2 {1,2}<br/>
document => 1 {1}<br/>
each => 2 {3,3}<br/>
english => 1 {1}<br/>
frequencies => 1 {2}<br/>
generate => 1 {1}<br/>
given => 1 {1}<br/>
in => 2 {1,3}<br/>
is => 1 {2}<br/>
label => 1 {3}<br/>
labeled => 1 {2}<br/>
list => 1 {2}<br/>
numbers => 1 {3}<br/>
occurrence => 1 {3}<br/>
occurrences => 1 {2}<br/>
of => 1 {2}<br/>
program => 1 {1}<br/>
sentence => 1 {3}<br/>
text => 1 {1}<br/>
that => 1 {1}<br/>
the => 1 {3}<br/>
which => 1 {3}<br/>
will => 1 {1}<br/>
with => 2 {2,3}<br/>
word => 3 {2,2,3}<br/>
write => 1 {1}<br/>
written => 1 {1}<br/>
