Please provide a Java program to answer the following question:

<p>
<i>
Given an arbitrary text document written in English, write a program that will generate a <b>concordance</b>. A <b>concordance</b> is an alphabetical list of all word occurrences labeled with word frequencies.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bonus</b> : label each word with the sentence numbers in which each occurrence appeared.
</i>
</p>

<p> 
The input is available in the file <b>input.txt</b>.
</p>

Sample output is as follows:

<pre>
a => 3 {1,1,2}
all => 1 {2}
alphabetical => 1 {2}
an => 2 {1,2}
appeared => 1 {3}
arbitrary => 1 {1}
bonus => 1 {3}
concordance => 2 {1,2}
document => 1 {1}
each => 2 {3,3}
english => 1 {1}
frequencies => 1 {2}
generate => 1 {1}
given => 1 {1}
in => 2 {1,3}
is => 1 {2}
label => 1 {3}
labeled => 1 {2}
list => 1 {2}
numbers => 1 {3}
occurrence => 1 {3}
occurrences => 1 {2}
of => 1 {2}
program => 1 {1}
sentence => 1 {3}
text => 1 {1}
that => 1 {1}
the => 1 {3}
which => 1 {3}
will => 1 {1}
